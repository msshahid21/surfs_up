# Surfs Up
## Project Overview
This purpose of this project is to help the stakeholders of a surf and ice cream shop to determine if the business will be sustainable year-round in Oahu. To help answer this question the following was performed:
- Summary Statistics of Temperatures in June
- Summary Statistics of Temperatures in December

## Resources
- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Python(3.7.13), Jupyter Notebook, Pandas(1.3.5), sqlalchemy

# Results

## Comparison
### Mean
June has much more datapoints compared to the December datapoints, 1700 to 1517. However, the mean temperature between the two months is still very similar. June has a mean temperature of 74.9°F and December has a mean temperature of 71.04°F. Both of these mean temperatures are fairly warm, and not too hot.

### Standard Deviation
Similarly to the mean, the standard deviation of temperature between the two months is very close. There is only a difference of 0.5°F, with the month of December being slightly more variant in temperatures compared to June.

### Max, Min and Median
The maximum temperatures between the two months is very similar between the two months, June with 85°F and December with 83°F. However, the minimum temperatures have a variance of 8°F, 64°F in June and 56°F in December. Medians in the two months are again similar, with only a difference of 4°F, with 75°F in June and 71°F in December.

# Summary
When combining all these measures, we can determine that both the months have a fairly similar spread of temperatures, with no leaning towards being very hot in June, or very cold in December. The median and mean are also almost the same in both months, indicating a bell shaped curve with no skewness.

Therefore, with these measures, it is a strong indication that the temperatures are ideal for both surfing and ice cream in Oahu.
